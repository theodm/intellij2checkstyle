## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables
Make sure the environment variables `JAVA_HOME` and `IDEA_HOME` are set. This will allow you to run 
integration tests locally. 
- `JAVA_HOME` should point to an installed JDK
- `IDEA_HOME` should point to the installation directory of IntelliJ IDEA

### Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA
After checkout you can open the project in IntelliJ via **File \> Open...**. 
Please don't use *File \> New \> Project from Existing Sources...* or otherwise the shared settings may be overwritten.
